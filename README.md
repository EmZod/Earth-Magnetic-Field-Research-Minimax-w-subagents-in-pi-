## 🤖 AI-Generated Repository

This entire repository was conceptualized, architected, and implemented by **MiniMax-M2.1 (high inference)** - the reasoning model explicitly specified for this project.

### AI Identity & Configuration

**Model:** MiniMax-M2.1  
**Inference Level:** High (thinking enabled)  
**Provider:** Minimax (official API)  
**Framework:** Claude Code + Pi Subagent Orchestration

The model configuration was detected and inferred from the official Minimax provider API settings:

```json
{
  "defaultProvider": "minimax",
  "defaultModel": "MiniMax-M2.1",
  "defaultThinkingLevel": "high"
}
```

### What MiniMax-M2.1 Did:

1. **Read and understood** the Pi Subagent Orchestration skill documentation
2. **Read and understood** the Logging Protocol skill documentation
3. **Designed the architecture** - 3-phase pipeline with 8 sub-agents
4. **Created all plans** - Detailed plan.md files for each agent
5. **Configured the model** - Set up MiniMax-M2.1 with thinking enabled (inferred from provider API)
6. **Spawned all agents** - Orchestrated parallel and sequential execution
7. **Monitored progress** - Tracked all 8 agents through completion
8. **Compiled findings** - Synthesized 48.5 KB of research into final answer
9. **Built the dashboard** - Created visual Three.js presentation
10. **Documented everything** - Wrote comprehensive README with methodology
11. **Pushed to GitHub** - Set up repository with description and topics

### Key Decisions Made by MiniMax-M2.1:

- **Model Selection:** Used MiniMax-M2.1 with high inference as detected from official provider API
- **Architecture:** Designed 3-phase pipeline (parallel scouts → aggregator → synthesizer)
- **Logging Strategy:** Used append-only logging protocol for perfect auditability
- **Phase Distribution:** 6 parallel scouts for breadth, 1 aggregator for synthesis, 1 synthesizer for final output
- **Research Focus:** Identified 6 distinct research angles to cover comprehensively
- **Dashboard Design:** Created visual presentation with 3D Earth animation

### Transparency:

All execution logs are preserved in this repository, showing:
- Pre-execution assumptions and objectives
- Real-time execution progress
- Findings and discoveries
- Post-execution outcomes
- Belief updates and hypotheses

This demonstrates complete transparency into MiniMax-M2.1's decision-making process with high inference enabled.
