# Earth's Magnetic Field Research: MiniMax-M2.1 Subagent Orchestration

## Executive Summary

This repository documents a comprehensive multi-agent research project investigating Earth's magnetic field changes and the scientific consensus on pole reversals. Using **MiniMax-M2.1 with thinking enabled**, we orchestrated **8 sub-agents across 3 phases** to produce a definitive 9.9KB research synthesis answering the core question:

> **Is Earth's magnetic field deteriorating, and is there evidence for significant events (like pole reversals) in our lifetime?**

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ YES: The field IS measurably changing (weakened ~10-15% since 1800s, pole accelerating toward Siberia at 55 km/year, South Atlantic Anomaly growing)
- ❌ NO: No credible evidence of imminent reversal—reversals are fundamentally unpredictable (Poisson process)

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Distributed Research (6 Parallel Scouts)

Each scout operated independently with:
- **Model:** MiniMax-M2.1 with thinking enabled (high reasoning)
- **Max Turns:** 25 per agent
- **Tools:** browser, bash, read, write
- **Logging:** Append-only `log.md` per agent (following logging protocol)

**Scout Assignments:**

| Scout | Research Focus | Key Questions |
|-------|---------------|---------------|
| scout-pole-reversal | Pole flip mechanics & predictions | When might reversal occur? What triggers it? |
| scout-field-strength | Field decay measurements | How fast is field weakening? Accelerating? |
| scout-south-atlantic-anomaly | SAA & regional anomalies | What's happening in SAA? Implications? |
| scout-recent-papers | 2024-2026 publications | What's cutting-edge research saying? |
| scout-prediction-models | Computational forecasts | What do models forecast for coming decades? |
| scout-historical-data | Paleomagnetic records | What does geological history tell us? |

**Research Protocol:**
1. Each scout read its `plan.md` for clear objectives and success criteria
2. Scouts maintained append-only execution logs following the logging protocol
3. Each scout produced `output/findings.md` with full citations and source URLs
4. All outputs captured to `output/` directory

### Phase 2: Synthesis (1 Aggregator)

The aggregator synthesized all Phase 1 outputs:
- **Read:** All 6 scout findings.md files
- **Process:** Identified consensus points and debates
- **Output:** `synthesis.md` (thematic organization) and `key-questions.md`

### Phase 3: Final Deliverable (1 Synthesizer)

The synthesizer produced the user-facing answer:
- **Read:** Phase 2 aggregation outputs
- **Output:** `final-answer.md` with direct answer to the core question

## Logging Protocol

This project strictly followed the **Logging Protocol** (see `/Users/jay/.claude/skills/logging-protocol/`):

### Key Principles:
1. **Append-Only Log:** Never edit previous entries. History is immutable.
2. **Forward-Only Fixes:** Backtracking = new step that fixes forward
3. **Atomic Steps:** Each step has Pre-Execution → Execution → Post-Execution
4. **Linear Readability:** Any agent can read logs top-to-bottom without graph traversal

### Log Structure Used:
```markdown
# STATE
## Current
step_id: STEP-XX
status: IN_PROGRESS
objective: [current objective]

## Decisions (append-only)
- STEP-01: [decision made]

## Blockers (append-only, mark resolved inline)
- STEP-03: [blocker] → RESOLVED: [how]

---

# STEP LOG (append-only)

## STEP-01
### Pre-Execution
Objective: [what to accomplish]
Beliefs: [what we believe]
Assumptions: [what we're assuming]

### Execution
- [x] Action taken
- Finding: [what discovered]

### Post-Execution
Outcome: PASS | PARTIAL | FAIL
Belief updates: [any changes]
```

### Where Logs Are Located:

**Orchestrator Logs:**
- `orchestrator/log.md` - Master orchestration execution log
- `orchestrator/decisions.md` - Pre-flight architectural decisions

**Agent Logs:**
- `phase1/scout-*/log.md` - Individual scout execution traces
- `phase2/aggregator/log.md` - Aggregator execution trace
- `phase3/synthesizer/log.md` - Synthesizer execution trace

---

## Subagent Orchestration Framework

This project used the **Pi Subagent Orchestration** skill (see `/Users/jay/.claude/skills/pi-subagent-orchestration/`):

### Design Principles:
- **Auditability over convenience:** Every action traceable
- **Git as source of truth:** All commits form canonical record
- **Subagents are expensive:** Spawn deliberately
- **Cleanup is mandatory:** Kill what you spawn
- **Simple over clever:** Boring solutions that work

### Resource Management:
- Each agent had `--max-turns 25` to prevent runaway execution
- tmux sessions used for observability (or `--print-last` for background)
- All processes tracked and cleaned up after completion

### Validation Criterion:
Before spawning any agent, we ensured:
> "Would a blank agent with only plan.md understand this task as self-evident?"

If not, the plan was improved until it was.

---

## Model Configuration

**Critical Note:** The `--model` CLI flag is IGNORED by Pi. Configuration must be set in `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "defaultProvider": "minimax",
  "defaultModel": "MiniMax-M2.1",
  "defaultThinkingLevel": "high"
}
```

This was set before any agent spawning to ensure all 8 sub-agents used:
- **Provider:** minimax
- **Model:** MiniMax-M2.1
- **Thinking:** enabled (high reasoning level)

## Research Findings Summary

### Direct Answer

**Yes, the field IS measurably changing:**
- Weakened ~10-15% since the 1800s
- North Magnetic Pole accelerating toward Siberia at ~55 km/year
- South Atlantic Anomaly grown significantly since 2014

**No, there is no credible evidence of imminent reversal:**
- Reversals are fundamentally unpredictable (Poisson process)
- Last reversal ~780,000 years ago (much longer than average ~450,000 year interval)
- Models can only predict ~5 years ahead; cannot predict reversals

### Key Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Field weakening rate | ~6.3% per century |
| Surface field strength | 25-65 microteslas |
| Pole migration speed | ~55 km/year (accelerating from ~10 km/year in 1900s) |
| SAA growth | ~½ continental Europe since 2014 |
| Reversals in 83M years | 183+ |
| Last full reversal | ~780,000 years ago |
| Reversal duration | 1,000-22,000 years |
| Reversal interval (average) | ~450,000 years |
| Prediction horizon | 5 years (operational models) |

### Scientific Consensus

**Agreed Upon (all scouts):**
1. Field is weakening (~10-15% since 1800s)
2. North pole accelerating toward Siberia
3. SAA is real, growing, deepening
4. Reversals are statistically random—no prediction possible
5. Last full reversal ~780,000 years ago
6. Reversal duration: 1,000-22,000 years
7. Field never disappears completely
8. WMM/IGRF reliable ~5 years ahead

**Debated Among Scientists:**
1. Current change significance (normal vs. unusual precursor)
2. Laschamp event causal links
3. Reversal probability after long Brunhes period
4. Duration estimates for past reversals

### Key Uncertainties

1. **Is current behavior "normal" or "unusual"?** — Open scientific question
2. **When will the next reversal occur?** — Fundamentally unpredictable
3. **How fast will future reversals be?** — Estimates vary by orders of magnitude
4. **What will be the effects?** — Some impacts known, others uncertain
