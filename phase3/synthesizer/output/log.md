## STEP-01: Reading Aggregator Output

### Key Findings from synthesis.md

**Current Field State:**
- Field strength: 25-65 μT at surface
- Weakening: 10-15% since 1800s (~6.3% per century)
- IMPORTANT: Current strength is average for last 7,000 years
- North pole accelerating: ~55 km/year toward Siberia (crossed into Eastern Hemisphere ~2020)
- South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA): Growing, deepening, expanded by ~½ Europe since 2014

**Historical Context:**
- 183+ reversals in past 83 million years
- Last full reversal: 780,000 years ago (Brunhes-Matuyama)
- Average interval: ~450,000 years
- Reversals are statistically random (Poisson process) - NO predictability

**Key Uncertainties:**
1. Is current behavior "normal" or unusual precursor?
2. When will next reversal occur? (Impossible to predict)
3. How fast do reversals happen? (200 to 22,000 years estimates)
4. What are biological effects?

**Critical Consensus Points (ALL scouts agree):**
- Field weakening is real (~10-15%)
- Pole acceleration is real (~55 km/year)
- SAA is real and growing
- Reversals are RANDOM - no prediction possible
- Field never disappears completely
- No clear reversal-extinction correlation

### Core Question to Address

User asks: "What is the current scientific understanding of Earth's magnetic field changes, and is there evidence for significant events (like pole reversals) in our lifetime?"

**Answer Summary:**
- YES, field is weakening and changing measurably
- NO, no evidence suggests reversal in our lifetime
- Reversals are fundamentally unpredictable
- Current changes may be normal variation or precursors - UNKNOWN
- Effects would be manageable over geological timescales

2. Evidence for/against imminent reversal
3. What latest research shows
4. Honest assessment of uncertainties
