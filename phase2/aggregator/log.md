### STEP-01: Read All Scout Outputs
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Completed**: 2026-01-13 21:30 GMT+5:30

All 6 Phase 1 findings files successfully ingested:
- ✅ scout-pole-reversal/output/findings.md
- ✅ scout-field-strength/output/findings.md
- ✅ scout-south-atlantic-anomaly/output/findings.md
- ✅ scout-recent-papers/output/findings.md
- ✅ scout-prediction-models/output/findings.md
- ✅ scout-historical-data/output/findings.md

**Key themes identified across scouts:**
1. Field weakening (10-15% since 1800s)
2. Pole acceleration toward Siberia (~55 km/year)
3. SAA growth and deepening
4. Reversal unpredictability (random, no precursor signals)
5. Normal variation vs. concerning signals debate
6. Historical analogs (Laschamp, Brunhes-Matuyama)

### STEP-02: Identify Consensus
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Completed**: 2026-01-13 21:35 GMT+5:30

**Consensus Points:**
1. ✅ Field weakened ~10-15% since 1800s
2. ✅ North pole accelerating toward Siberia (~55 km/year)
3. ✅ SAA is real, growing, deepening since 2014
4. ✅ Reversals are statistically random - no prediction possible
5. ✅ Last full reversal: Brunhes-Matuyama ~780,000 years ago
6. ✅ Reversal duration: 1,000-22,000 years (variable)
7. ✅ Field never disappears completely during reversal
8. ✅ WMM/IGRF reliable only ~5 years ahead
9. ✅ Current strength is average for last 7,000 years
10. ✅ No correlation between reversals and mass extinctions

### STEP-03: Identify Debates/Contradictions
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Completed**: 2026-01-13 21:35 GMT+5:30

**Debates Identified:**
1. **Normal vs. Unusual Current Changes**
   - Some scouts: "within normal historical variation"
   - Historical data scout: SAA and long Brunhes period suggest "unusual"
   
2. **Brunhes-Matuyama Duration**
   - Singer et al 2019: ~22,000 years
   - Other estimates: ~200 years to few thousand
   
3. **Laschamp Event Causation**
   - Cooper et al 2021: links to Neanderthal extinction
   - Other sources: "causation not established"
   
4. **Reversal Imminent?**
   - Scientific consensus: "no evidence"
   - But long Brunhes period increases statistical probability

### STEP-04: Thematic Organization
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Completed**: 2026-01-13 21:40 GMT+5:30

**Themes:**
1. Current Field State (strength, pole positions, SAA)
2. Historical Patterns (reversals, excursions, superchrons)
3. Prediction Capabilities (models, limits, randomness)
4. Potential Effects (cosmic radiation, technology, climate)
5. Key Uncertainties (duration, precursors, timing)
