## High-Priority Research Questions

### 1. Is the Current Field Weakening "Normal" or Unusual?

**Question**: Are the current field weakening, pole acceleration, and SAA development within normal geological variation, or do they represent unusual precursor activity indicating an approaching reversal?

**Evidence on each side**:
- **For "normal"**: Current field strength is average for last 7,000 years; 10-15% decline since 1800s is within paleomagnetic variation; field has recovered from similar declines before
- **For "unusual"**: SAA development is unprecedented in recent geological history; 781,000-year Brunhes period is unusually long; SAA growth accelerating since 2020

**Why it matters**: Determines whether current observations should be cause for concern or simply routine geological activity.

### 2. When Will the Next Geomagnetic Reversal Occur?

**Question**: Is it possible to predict when the next full reversal will happen, and does the long Brunhes normal period (780,000 years vs. ~450,000 average) increase the probability?

**Current understanding**:
- Reversals are statistically random (Poisson process)
- No precursor signals have been identified
- The next reversal could occur tomorrow or in 500,000 years
- Claims of periodicity are analytical artifacts

**Research needed**: Better understanding of reversal triggering mechanisms; identification of any statistical early warning signals.

### 3. How Fast Do Reversals Actually Occur?

**Question**: What is the typical duration of polarity transitions, and how much does duration vary between events?

**Conflicting estimates**:
- Laschamp excursion (~42,000 years ago): ~690 years total
- Brunhes-Matuyama reversal estimates: 200 years to 22,000 years
- Computer simulations: Can produce reversals within human lifetime

**Why it matters**: Duration affects severity of biological and technological impacts; short reversals allow less adaptation time.

---

### 4. What Are the Biological Effects of Field Weakening?

**Question**: Did the Laschamp event cause the environmental changes and extinctions attributed to it, and what does this mean for a potential future reversal?

**Evidence**:
- Cooper et al. 2021 links Laschamp to Neanderthal extinction, megafauna die-offs, climate shifts
- Other researchers dispute causation, arguing correlation only
- Beryllium-10 spikes in ice cores confirm increased cosmic ray flux

**Research needed**: Better paleoclimate records; causal mechanism studies; dose-response relationships for radiation effects.

### 5. What Drives SAA Evolution?

**Question**: What core-mantle boundary processes cause the SAA to form, grow, and accelerate?

**Known**:
- Caused by reverse flux patches where field lines loop back into core
- African LLSVP (Large Low-Shear-Velocity Province) may play a role
- SAA has expanded by ~½ Europe since 2014

**Unknown**:
- Why is the African sector weakening faster since 2020?
- Will SAA continue growing, stabilize, or diminish?
- Is SAA related to impending reversal or independent phenomenon?

## Medium-Priority Questions

### 6. Can Geodynamo Simulations Become Predictive?

**Question**: Will increases in computing power and improved physical parameters allow numerical simulations to forecast field evolution beyond 5 years?

**Current state**:
- Simulations reproduce reversals but don't predict them
- Require unrealistic parameters (high viscosity)
- Cannot run at Earth-realistic conditions

**Research direction**: More realistic core conditions; machine learning approaches; hybrid statistical-dynamical methods.

---

### 7. What Controls Reversal Frequency?

**Question**: Why do reversal frequencies vary so dramatically, and what causes superchrons?

**Observations**:
- Reversals range from ~10,000/year to 0/million years (superchrons)
- Mechanism for superchron onset/termination unknown
- May relate to core-mantle heat flux patterns

**Research needed**: Better paleomagnetic records; core dynamics modeling; linking superchrons to mantle convection.

---

### 8. How Will Technology Cope During a Reversal?

**Question**: What mitigation strategies are needed for satellites, power grids, and communication systems during a reversal?

**Known**:
- SAA already causes satellite operational issues
- Radiation hardening and operational procedures can mitigate effects
- Aviation can reduce exposure by flying lower/southern latitudes

**Research needed**: Realistic scenario modeling; infrastructure hardening standards; early warning systems.

## Lower-Priority but Interesting Questions

### 9. Why Does the North Pole Move Faster Than the South Pole?

**Question**: What asymmetric core dynamics cause the dramatic difference in pole migration rates?

### 10. Can Space-Based Magnetometers Improve Predictions?

**Question**: How much would additional satellite missions (beyond Swarm) improve model accuracy and prediction horizons?

### 11. Are There Reversal "Precursors" We Haven't Identified?

**Question**: Is it possible that subtle signals precede reversals that we haven't yet recognized or measured?

### 12. How Does the Solar Cycle Affect Field Observations?

**Question**: Should the predicted weak solar polar fields for 2026 affect interpretation of magnetic field measurements?

## Recommendations for Phase 3

1. **Prioritize SAA monitoring**: Continue and expand Swarm-equivalent satellite coverage
2. **Improve paleomagnetic resolution**: Higher-precision dating of reversal events
3. **Develop impact models**: Realistic scenarios for technology and biological effects
4. **Study core dynamics**: Better understanding of what controls reversal timing
5. **Maintain observation networks**: Ground observatories essential for model validation
