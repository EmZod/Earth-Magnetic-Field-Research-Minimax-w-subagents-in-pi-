Earth's magnetic field is weakening by ~6.3% per century with the North Magnetic Pole accelerating toward Siberia at ~55 km/year, while the South Atlantic Anomaly has grown by roughly half the size of continental Europe since 2014—changes that are scientifically significant but fall within historical norms according to some researchers while appearing unusual on geological timescales according to others. The scientific consensus is clear that geomagnetic reversals are statistically random events with no predictable pattern or precursor signals, meaning the next reversal could occur anywhere from tomorrow to hundreds of thousands of years from now; the last full reversal was the Brunhes-Matuyama event ~780,000 years ago, and reversals typically take 1,000-22,000 years to complete while reducing field strength to 5-10% of current levels. Current operational prediction models (WMM2025, IGRF-14) are reliable for approximately five years ahead but fundamentally cannot predict reversals due to chaotic core dynamics. The primary uncertainties concern whether current changes represent normal variation or unusual precursor activity, how fast future reversals might occur, and what biological and technological effects a reversal might produce—with the Laschamp excursion ~42,000 years ago providing the best historical analog showing increased cosmic radiation, potential climate effects, and possible links to megafauna extinctions, though causation remains debated.
