The South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) is a region of significantly weakened Earth's magnetic field over the South Atlantic that has expanded by nearly half the size of continental Europe since 2014, with accelerated weakening detected southwest of Africa since 2020, according to ESA's Swarm satellite constellation data published in 2025. This anomaly, caused by "reverse flux patches" where magnetic field lines loop back into Earth's core instead of emerging normally, poses practical risks for satellite operations by allowing increased radiation exposure. While the SAA reveals complex dynamics in Earth's liquid outer core and the northern magnetic pole continues drifting toward Siberia, scientists caution against interpreting the SAA as definitive evidence of an imminent geomagnetic pole reversal—field reversals typically unfold over thousands of years, and the current weakening may stabilize or reverse naturally. The Swarm mission, now providing over 11 years of continuous magnetic field measurements, continues monitoring these changes through its expected extension to 2030.
