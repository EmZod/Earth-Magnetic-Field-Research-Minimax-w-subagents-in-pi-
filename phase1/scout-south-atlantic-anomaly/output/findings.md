## Executive Summary

The South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) is a region of significantly weakened Earth's magnetic field located over the South Atlantic Ocean, stretching from South America to southwest Africa. According to 2025 data from ESA's Swarm satellite constellation, the SAA has expanded by an area nearly half the size of continental Europe since 2014, with accelerated weakening detected southwest of Africa since 2020. While this anomaly poses practical risks for satellite operations due to increased radiation exposure, scientists caution against interpreting it as definitive evidence of an imminent geomagnetic pole reversal.

## SAA Characteristics

### Location and Extent
- **Primary Location**: Southeast of South America, extending across the South Atlantic towards southwest Africa
- **First Identified**: 19th century
- **Current Extent**: Nearly half the size of continental Europe (as of 2025)

### Physical Cause
The SAA is caused by **reverse flux patches** at the boundary between Earth's liquid outer core and rocky mantle:
- Normally, magnetic field lines emerge from the core in the southern hemisphere
- Under the SAA region, field lines unexpectedly loop **back into** the core
- This creates a region of anomalously weak magnetic field at the surface

### Strength and Intensity
- The magnetic field in this region is significantly weaker than global averages
- One reverse flux patch is currently **moving westward over Africa**
- The region southwest of Africa has experienced faster weakening since 2020

## SAA Evolution (2014-2025)

| Period | Key Observation |
|--------|-----------------|
| 2013 | Swarm satellites launched (November 22) |
| 2014-2020 | Steady SAA expansion observed |
| 2020-2025 | Accelerated weakening southwest of Africa |
| 2025 | SAA covers area ~½ size of continental Europe |

### Regional Magnetic Field Changes

| Region | Change | Surface Area Impact |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Canada | Weakening | Shrunk by 0.65% (nearly size of India) |
| Siberia | Strengthening | Grown by 0.42% (size of Greenland) |
| South Atlantic | Weakening | Expanded by ~½ Europe |

### Northern Pole Movement
- The northern magnetic pole continues to drift **toward Siberia**
- This shift affects navigation systems globally

## Practical Implications

### Satellite Operations
Satellites passing over the SAA face:
- **Higher radiation doses** from cosmic rays and solar particles
- **Potential malfunctions** in critical hardware
- **Risk of blackouts** in satellite systems

### Aviation
- Aircraft flying over the region experience elevated radiation
- Generally not a concern for commercial aviation at cruise altitudes
- More relevant for high-altitude polar routes

### Navigation
- The shifting magnetic poles require regular updates to navigation models
- Swarm data underpins global magnetic models used for navigation

## SAA and Geomagnetic Reversal: Assessment

### What the Science Says

**Expert Quote** (Prof. Chris Finlay, Technical University of Denmark):
> "The South Atlantic Anomaly is not just a single block. It's changing differently towards Africa than it is near South America. There's something special happening in this region that is causing the field to weaken in a more intense way."

### Key Points

1. **The SAA reveals complex core dynamics** - The reverse flux patches and their movement provide valuable data about processes deep within Earth.

2. **No definitive reversal signal** - While the SAA is scientifically significant, the 2025 Swarm research does not claim it indicates an imminent pole reversal.

3. **Reversal timescales are long** - Geomagnetic reversals typically unfold over thousands of years. Current observations span only decades.

4. **The field is dynamic** - Magnetic field strengthening in Siberia and weakening over Canada shows the field is constantly evolving, not simply declining globally.

### Historical Context
- Last full geomagnetic reversal (Brunhes-Matuyama): ~780,000 years ago
- The field has reversed hundreds of times in Earth's history
- Reversals are gradual processes, not sudden events

## Conclusions

1. **The SAA is real and significant** - It represents a genuine weakening of Earth's magnetic shield with practical implications for space infrastructure.

2. **The SAA is growing** - Since 2014, the anomaly has expanded considerably, with recent acceleration in the African sector.

3. **Reversal risk is uncertain** - While the SAA is linked to unusual core dynamics, attributing it to an imminent reversal would be speculative. More data and longer observation periods are needed.

4. **Swarm is crucial** - The 11+ years of continuous Swarm observations provide unprecedented insights into magnetic field dynamics and are essential for improving predictive models.

## Future Outlook

- **Swarm mission extended** through 2030, with potential for longer
- Solar minimum around 2030 will enable enhanced observations
- Continued monitoring will reveal whether the SAA stabilizes, grows, or diminishes
- Enhanced understanding will improve:
  - Space weather forecasting
  - Satellite hardening strategies
  - Navigation accuracy
  - Core dynamics models
