**KEY FINDINGS FROM PAPERS:**

**Paper 1: WMM2025 - World Magnetic Model 2025-2030**
- Released December 17, 2024, valid until December 31, 2029
- Jointly developed by NGA (US), DGC (UK), NCEI, and British Geological Survey
- Provides updated coefficients for main field and secular variation
- Includes WMMHR (high-resolution) version with coverage up to degree 15
- Critical for navigation, attitude, and heading reference systems

**Paper 2: The May 2024 Storm (Gannon Storm) - Ng et al.**
- CME arrival May 10, 2024 caused the most intense geomagnetic storm in 20 years
- Magnetopause moved inward to ~4 RE (Earth radii)
- Cusps manifested as nearly parallel emission ridges in simulated X-Ray
- First observation of cusp ridge movement to higher latitudes after IMF reversal
- Novel finding: X-Ray imaging can detect magnetopause and cusps for future missions

**Paper 3: CME Evolution - Khuntia et al. (2025)**
- Six Earth-directed CMEs identified interacting en route to Earth
- Interaction heights determined; formed complex ejecta at 1 AU
- First paper to track thermal evolution from Sun to Earth
- Most CMEs became isothermal at 6-9 Rsun (solar radii)
- Complex ejecta showed predominant heat-release state in electrons
- KEY INSIGHT: CME-CME interactions significantly alter post-interaction characteristics

**Paper 4: Aviation Radiation Mitigation - Tobiska et al. (2025)**
- Validated ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) strategy during Gannon storm
- Two UAL 990 flights: one during storm (May 10-11, 2024), one quiet (June 8-9, 2025)
- Demonstrated magnetic field shielding and altitude shielding as effective countermeasures
- Flying lower magnetic latitudes provides more Earth magnetic field shielding
- Flying lower altitudes uses atmosphere depth for shielding
- Both methods controllable in airline operations and air traffic management

**Paper 5: Solar Polar Fields 2026 - Wang et al. (2025)**
- Solar Cycle 25 now in declining phase - critical period for polar field establishment
- Northern polar field expected to decline sharply until March 2026
- Northern field will become "exceptionally weak" - lowest in 5 solar cycles
- Southern field remains relatively weak
- Raises concerns about Cycle 25/26 minimum strength and Cycle 26 amplitude
