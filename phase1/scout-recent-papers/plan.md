## Objective
Find and analyze the most recent scientific publications (2024-2026) on Earth's magnetic field, focusing on any new findings that update our understanding.

## Scope
### In Scope
- Papers from 2024, 2025, early 2026
- Nature, Science, AGU, EGU journals
- New discoveries or updated predictions
- Emerging research directions
- Any paradigm shifts or controversies

### Out of Scope
- Older research (pre-2024)
- Detailed mechanics (other scouts)
- Historical data (other scout)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Found 5+ recent papers (2024-2026)
- [ ] Documented key findings from each
- [ ] Identified any new consensus or debates
- [ ] Full citations with DOIs/URLs
- [ ] Summary in output/findings.md

## Steps

### STEP-01: Search Recent Literature
**Objective**: Find cutting-edge papers
**Target**: Google Scholar, arXiv, journal sites
**Actions**:
1. Search "Earth magnetic field 2025" on Google Scholar
2. Search "geomagnetic reversal 2024 2025" 
3. Check Nature Geoscience, JGR, EPSL recent issues
**Success criteria**: List of 5+ relevant papers
**Output**: Paper list in log.md

### STEP-02: Analyze Key Papers
**Objective**: Extract key findings
**Target**: Paper abstracts and conclusions
**Actions**:
1. For each paper: title, authors, date, key findings
2. Note any surprising or novel results
3. Identify common themes
**Success criteria**: Detailed notes on each paper
**Output**: Paper analysis

### STEP-03: Identify Trends
**Objective**: Synthesize research directions
**Target**: Cross-paper analysis
**Actions**:
1. What questions are researchers focused on?
2. Any emerging consensus?
3. Any major disagreements?
**Success criteria**: Research landscape summary
**Output**: Trend analysis

### STEP-04: Final Output
**Objective**: Compile deliverables
**Actions**:
1. Write output/findings.md with paper summaries
2. Include full citations
3. Write output/summary.txt (one paragraph)
**Output**: output/findings.md, output/summary.txt

## Logging Requirements
Create and maintain append-only `log.md`. NEVER edit previous entries.
