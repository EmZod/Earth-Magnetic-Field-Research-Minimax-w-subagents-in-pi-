## Executive Summary

This report summarizes key findings from recent (2024-2026) scientific publications on Earth's magnetic field. The dominant research theme is the extraordinary May 2024 geomagnetic storm (Gannon storm)—the most intense in two decades—which generated substantial new research on magnetopause dynamics, coronal mass ejection (CME) interactions, and practical mitigation strategies for aviation and navigation systems. Additionally, significant advances have been made in solar cycle prediction and operational magnetic field modeling through the WMM2025 release.

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2512.03890

**Key Findings:**
- The coronal mass ejection (CME) of May 10, 2024 caused the most intense geomagnetic storm in 20 years
- Magnetopause compressed inward to approximately 4 Earth radii (RE)—unusually close
- Cusps appeared as nearly parallel emission ridges in simulated soft X-ray imaging
- Cusp ridges moved to higher latitudes for ~10 minutes after interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) reversal
- Novel finding: Soft X-ray emission from solar wind charge exchange can image magnetopause and cusps
- Future X-ray imagers on space missions could provide global views with quantitative location data

### 3. Evolution of Interacting Coronal Mass Ejections Driving the Great Geomagnetic Storm on 10 May 2024

**Citation:** Khuntia, S., Mishra, W., Agarwal, A. (2025). Evolution of interacting coronal mass ejections driving the great geomagnetic storm on 10 May 2024. Astronomy & Astrophysics. arXiv:2504.03335.

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2504.03335

**Key Findings:**
- Six Earth-directed CMEs were identified interacting en route to Earth
- First study to track thermal evolution of CMEs from the Sun to 1 AU
- Interaction heights of CMEs determined; formed complex ejecta at Earth's orbit
- Most CMEs transitioned to an isothermal state at 6-9 solar radii (Rsun)
- One CME (CME4) exhibited adiabatic state due to slower expansion rate
- Complex ejecta showed predominant heat-release state in electrons; ions showed bimodal distribution
- **Critical Insight:** One-to-one comparison of CME characteristics from Sun to Earth is difficult due to interaction effects

### 4. Advances in Aviation Radiation Mitigation During the Gannon Storm

**Citation:** Tobiska, W.K., Hogan, B., Didkovsky, L., Judge, K., Bailey, J., Drumm, K., Wahl, K., Sosnov, A. (2025). Advances in aviation radiation mitigation were demonstrated during the Gannon storm. arXiv:2507.00887.

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2507.00887

**Key Findings:**
- Validated ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) radiation mitigation strategy
- Two identical UAL 990 flights (San Francisco-Paris) with ARMAS FM7 radiation monitors
- Flight 1: May 10-11, 2024 during Gannon storm (extreme space weather)
- Flight 2: June 8-9, 2025 during quiet geomagnetic conditions
- **Two Effective Shielding Strategies:**
  1. Fly lower magnetic latitudes → gain more Earth magnetic field shielding
  2. Fly lower altitudes → use atmospheric depth for shielding
- Both methods are controllable in airline operations and air traffic management
- Reduces risks: HF communication outages, GNSS navigation errors, radiation exposure
- Establishes operational standards for aviation safety during extreme space weather

- Complex ejecta formation mechanisms elucidated

## Key Consensus Points

1. **Extreme storms are predictable but their effects require preparation** – The Gannon storm was well-forecast, and its effects on aviation and infrastructure were manageable due to advance warning.

2. **Earth's magnetic field continues to drift** – Secular variation is ongoing, requiring regular model updates (WMM2025).

3. **CME interactions significantly alter space weather effects** – Multi-CME events create complex ejecta that are difficult to characterize.

4. **Solar Cycle 25 may be weaker than expected** – Weak polar field predictions suggest potential for a below-average Cycle 26.

## Areas of Ongoing Research / Debates

1. **CME interaction predictability** – While interactions are now better understood, predicting their occurrence remains challenging.

2. **SAMA variability** – The South Atlantic Magnetic Anomaly continues to show complex behavior during storms.

3. **Long-term solar cycle amplitude** – Weak polar field predictions raise questions about Cycle 26 strength, but uncertainty remains.
