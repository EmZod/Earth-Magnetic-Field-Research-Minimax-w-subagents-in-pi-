RECENT EARTH MAGNETIC FIELD RESEARCH (2024-2026) - SUMMARY
=========================================================

This scout mission identified seven recent publications (2024-2026) on Earth's magnetic field, revealing that the dominant research theme is the extraordinary May 2024 "Gannon storm"—the most intense geomagnetic storm in two decades. This event generated substantial new findings: the magnetopause compressed to an unusually close 4 Earth radii, cusps appeared as parallel X-ray emission ridges, and multiple interacting coronal mass ejections (CMEs) created complex ejecta at Earth's orbit. The WMM2025 model was released in December 2024 with updated coefficients for navigation systems. Aviation research validated that flying at lower magnetic latitudes and altitudes significantly reduces radiation exposure during extreme storms. Meanwhile, solar cycle predictions raise concerns about unusually weak polar fields in 2026, potentially indicating a below-average Cycle 26. No paradigm shifts were identified, but significant advances in extreme storm understanding and operational applications were documented.
