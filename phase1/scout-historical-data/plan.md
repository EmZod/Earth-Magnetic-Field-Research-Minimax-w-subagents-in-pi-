# Plan: Research Historical and Paleomagnetic Data

## Agent
- Name: scout-historical-data
- Role: scout
- Model: MiniMax-M2.1 (thinking enabled)
- Tools: browser, bash, read, write

## Objective
Research geological and paleomagnetic records to understand Earth's magnetic field history and what it tells us about current changes.

## Scope
### In Scope
- Paleomagnetic record (rocks, sediments)
- Historical reversal patterns
- Duration and effects of past reversals
- Laschamp, Brunhes-Matuyama events
- What history tells us about current changes
- 2024-2026 paleomagnetic discoveries

### Out of Scope
- Current measurements (other scouts)
- Prediction models (other scout)
- SAA details (other scout)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Documented reversal history
- [ ] Found past reversal durations/effects
- [ ] Connected history to current situation
- [ ] Cited authoritative sources
- [ ] Summary in output/findings.md

## Steps

### STEP-01: Reversal History
**Objective**: Understand historical reversal patterns
**Target**: Paleomagnetic literature
**Actions**:
1. Search "paleomagnetic reversal history Earth"
2. Find frequency of reversals
3. Document major reversal events
**Success criteria**: Historical timeline
**Output**: History notes in log.md

### STEP-02: Past Reversal Details
**Objective**: What happened during past reversals?
**Target**: Studies of Laschamp, other events
**Actions**:
1. Search "Laschamp event effects"
2. How long did reversals take?
3. What were the effects on life, climate?
**Success criteria**: Event case studies
**Output**: Event analysis

### STEP-03: Lessons for Today
**Objective**: What does history tell us about now?
**Target**: Comparative analysis papers
**Actions**:
1. Is current decay unusual historically?
2. How does current situation compare?
3. What can we learn from past events?
**Success criteria**: Historical context for current changes
**Output**: Contextual analysis

### STEP-04: Final Output
**Objective**: Compile deliverables
**Actions**:
1. Write output/findings.md
2. Include all source URLs
3. Write output/summary.txt
**Output**: output/findings.md, output/summary.txt

## Logging Requirements
Create and maintain append-only `log.md`. NEVER edit previous entries.
