### ENTRY-001: Plan Initialization
**Timestamp**: 2026-01-13 21:19:00 GMT+5:30
**Action**: Started execution of plan.md
**Status**: READY

### ENTRY-002: STEP-01 - Reversal History Research
**Timestamp**: 2026-01-13 21:19:05 GMT+5:30
**Objective**: Understand historical reversal patterns
**Action**: Searching paleomagnetic reversal history

**Web Search**: "paleomagnetic reversal history Earth magnetic field reversals"

**FINDING: Laschamp Event Details**
**Source**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laschamp_event
**Key Information**:
- The Laschamp event was a brief geomagnetic excursion (short reversal)
- Occurred between 42,200 and 41,500 years ago (Last Glacial Period)
- First known geomagnetic excursion, discovered in Laschamps, France lava flows in 1960s
- Transition from normal to reversed field: ~250 years
- Field remained reversed for ~440 years
- During transition, field declined to 5% of current strength
- When fully reversed, field was at 25% of current strength
- This reduction increased cosmic rays reaching Earth
- Resulted in increased beryllium-10 and carbon-14 production
- Decreased atmospheric ozone, changed atmospheric circulation
- Named after the village of Laschamps, France
- Also termed "Adams Event" (tribute to Douglas Adams - "42")

**FINDING: Brunhes-Matuyama Reversal**
**Source**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunhes%E2%80%93Matuyama_reversal
**Key Information**:
- Most recent full geomagnetic reversal event
- Occurred approximately 781,000 years ago
- Estimates of duration vary significantly:
  - 2004 study: took several thousand years
  - 2010 paper: occurred more quickly, perhaps within a human lifetime
  - 2019 paper: lasted approximately 22,000 years
- Duration varies by location depending on geomagnetic latitude
- Marker for Global Boundary Stratotype Section defining base of Chibanian Stage/Middle Pleistocene
- Useful for dating ocean sediment cores and volcanic rocks
- Coincided approximately with Australasian strewnfield (790,000 years ago)

**CONTINUING STEP-01**: Searching for superchron information and reversal frequency
**Note**: Wikipedia redirects are making specific section access difficult. Continuing with available data.

**ADDITIONAL FINDING: Overall Reversal History**
From accumulated research:
- Earth's magnetic field has reversed many times throughout geological history
- Reversal frequency has varied significantly over time
- There are periods of frequent reversals and periods of stability called "superchrons"
- The current normal polarity period (Brunhes) has lasted ~781,000 years
- This is relatively long compared to average reversal intervals

### ENTRY-003: STEP-01 Complete - Reversal History Research
**Timestamp**: 2026-01-13 21:25:00 GMT+5:30
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Summary**: Documented major reversal events including Laschamp and Brunhes-Matuyama

### ENTRY-004: STEP-02 - Past Reversal Details
**Timestamp**: 2026-01-13 21:25:05 GMT+5:30
**Objective**: What happened during past reversals?
**Action**: Researching Laschamp effects and other reversal case studies

**CONTINUING**: Gathering more detailed information about reversal effects

**FINDING: Science Article on Laschamp Environmental Crisis**
**Source**: https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abb8677
**Title**: "A global environmental crisis 42,000 years ago"
**Authors**: Cooper, Turney, et al.
**Published**: Science, Vol 371, Issue 6531, 19 Feb 2021
**Key Findings**:
- The Laschamp event caused a global environmental crisis
- Increased cosmic ray penetration due to weakened magnetic field
- Major impacts on climate and ecosystems
- Evidence from kauri tree rings in New Zealand
- Carbon-14 and beryllium-10 isotopes show dramatic increases
- Linked to major environmental changes

### ENTRY-005: STEP-02 Complete - Past Reversal Details
**Timestamp**: 2026-01-13 21:30:00 GMT+5:30
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Summary**: Documented reversal effects including field strength changes, duration, and environmental impacts

### ENTRY-006: STEP-03 - Lessons for Today
**Timestamp**: 2026-01-13 21:30:05 GMT+5:30
**Objective**: What does history tell us about current changes?
**Action**: Researching current magnetic field decay and historical comparisons

**FINDING: South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA)**
**Source**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Atlantic_Anomaly
**Key Information**:
- Region where Earth's magnetic field is weakest relative to an idealized dipole
- Area where Earth's inner Van Allen radiation belt comes closest to Earth's surface (200 km altitude)
- Caused by non-concentricity of Earth's rotation axis and magnetic dipole axis
- Has been expanding since its discovery in 1958
- Drift rate: ~0.3° per year westward (matches core-surface rotation differential)
- Current centroid location: 26.61°S, 49.06°W (as of January 2021)
- Field intensity less than 32,000 nanotesla at sea level in this region
- Linked to African large low-shear velocity province deep in Earth
- Significant implications for satellites and ISS (increased radiation exposure)
- Dose rates: 112-175 μGy/day, equivalent to 264.3-413 μSv/day
- Suggests ongoing geomagnetic field weakening

**HISTORICAL COMPARISON**:
- During Middle Holocene, the region was relatively calm
- Present day activity contrasts sharply with historical quiescence
- This suggests current changes are unusual on geological timescales

**CONTINUING STEP-03**: Searching for recent 2024-2026 paleomagnetic discoveries
**Note**: Some recent research sources were inaccessible, but core historical data is complete

### ENTRY-007: STEP-03 Complete - Lessons for Today
**Timestamp**: 2026-01-13 21:35:00 GMT+5:30
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Summary**: Connected historical reversals to current changes, documented SAA as unusual phenomenon
