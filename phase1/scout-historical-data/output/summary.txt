EARTH'S MAGNETIC FIELD HISTORY - RESEARCH SUMMARY
==================================================

KEY FINDINGS:
-------------

1. REVERSAL HISTORY
   - Earth's magnetic field reverses frequently throughout geological history
   - Last full reversal (Brunhes-Matuyama): 781,000 years ago
   - Last major excursion (Laschamp): 42,000 years ago
   - Reversal frequency varies; current polarity is unusually long

2. LASCHAMP EVENT (42,000 years ago)
   - Brief geomagnetic excursion with major environmental impacts
   - Field strength dropped to 5% of current levels during transition
   - Transition took ~250 years, reversal lasted ~440 years
   - Caused increased cosmic radiation, ozone depletion, climate changes
   - Linked to megafauna extinctions and Neanderthal disappearance

3. CURRENT CHANGES - SOUTH ATLANTIC ANOMALY
   - Region of significantly weakened magnetic field (26.6°S, 49°W)
   - Has been expanding since first observed in 1958
   - Field strength < 32,000 nanotesla (normal is ~50,000+ nanotesla)
   - Increases radiation exposure for satellites and ISS
   - Unusual on geological timescales (Middle Holocene was calm)

4. HISTORICAL CONTEXT
   - Current normal polarity period (781,000 years) is unusually long
   - Field decay rate appears significant compared to paleomagnetic record
   - Suggests we may be approaching another reversal

5. IMPLICATIONS
   - Reversals are natural but cause significant environmental effects
   - Field weakness (not polarity) drives cosmic radiation increases
   - Current changes may be unprecedented in recent geological history
   - High uncertainty remains about reversal timing and effects
