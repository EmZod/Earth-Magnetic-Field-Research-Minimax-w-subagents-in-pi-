Earth's magnetic field has reversed polarity at least 183 times over the past 83 million years, with the last full reversal occurring approximately 780,000 years ago. These reversals are caused by complex fluid dynamics in Earth's liquid outer core and occur randomly, making it impossible for scientists to predict when the next reversal will happen. While the field has weakened 10-15% since the 1800s and the North Pole is drifting faster toward Siberia, current observations are within normal historical variation and do not indicate an imminent reversal. The process typically takes 1,000-22,000 years to complete, and Earth's atmosphere would still provide significant protection even during the transition. No scientific evidence supports claims of an impending pole reversal.
