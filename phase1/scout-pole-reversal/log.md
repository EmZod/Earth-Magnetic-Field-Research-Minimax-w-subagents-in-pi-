**Progress**:
- Navigating to search for authoritative sources on geomagnetic reversals

**Sources Found**:
1. [NASA - Earth's Magnetic Field](https://www.nasa.gov/subject/6892/earths-magnetic-field/)
2. [ESA - Magnetic North Pole Movement](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Swarm_unveils_latest_insights_into_Earth_s_protective_magnetic_shield)

4. [ScienceDirect - Geomagnetism](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/earth-and-planetary-science-letters)
5. Wikipedia - Geomagnetic reversal (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_reversal)
6. Wikipedia - Earth's magnetic field (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_magnetic_field)

**Detailed Findings from Sources**:
- At least 183 reversals over last 83 million years (average once every ~450,000 years)
- Latest reversal (Brunhes-Matuyama) occurred 780,000 years ago
- Duration estimates: 1,000-10,000 years typical, some as quick as 200 years
- 2019 research: Most recent reversal lasted ~22,000 years
- Reversals appear statistically random with no periodicity

**Key Sources Identified**:
1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_reversal
2. NASA simulations by Glatzmaier and Roberts
3. Science Advances 2019 paper (Singer et al.)

**Outcome**: PASS
**Status**: COMPLETE

## STEP-02: Document Reversal Mechanics
**Timestamp**: 2026-01-13 19:35:00 GMT+5:30
**Objective**: Understand what causes pole reversals
**Target**: Scientific explanations of core dynamics

**Core Mechanics**:
- Generated by geodynamo: electric currents in Earth's outer core (molten iron/nickel convection)
- Convection driven by heat escaping from inner core + compositional convection
- Coriolis effect organizes flow into rolls aligned with rotational axis
- Feedback loop: current loops generate magnetic fields → changing field generates electric field
- Average field strength in outer core: ~25 gauss (50x surface strength)

**Reversal Process**:
- Magnetic field becomes unstable and spontaneously flips orientation
- Occurs during periods of low field strength
- Multiple poles may form chaotically during transition
- Field does not vanish completely during reversal
- Simulations show reversals emerge spontaneously from underlying core dynamics

**Duration of Reversals**:
- Typical range: 1,000-10,000 years
- 2018 research: Some reversals may take only ~200 years
- 2019 Science Advances: Brunhes-Matuyama lasted ~22,000 years
- Directional changes can reach 6-10 degrees per day during intense transitions
- 2020 study: Maximum directional change rates ~10° per year

**Evidence of Mechanics**:
- NASA/Glatzmaier-Roberts computer simulations successfully reproduce reversals
- Laboratory liquid metal experiment (VKS2) shows similar field reversals
- Solar magnetic field reverses every 9-12 years (observed analog)

**Outcome**: PASS
**Status**: COMPLETE

## STEP-03: Timeline and Predictions
**Timestamp**: 2026-01-13 19:40:00 GMT+5:30
**Objective**: Find current predictions for next reversal
**Target**: Recent papers, expert statements, 2024-2026 findings

**Current Scientific Consensus**:
- No imminent reversal predicted - we are in the Brunhes Normal Polarity Chron
- Last full reversal: 780,000 years ago (Brunhes-Matuyama)
- Reversals are statistically random - no reliable prediction method exists
- Average interval between reversals: ~450,000 years over past 83 million years
- Highly variable: from <100,000 to 50 million years between reversals

**Recent Observations (Notable but not predictive)**:
1. Field strength has declined ~10-15% since 1800s, accelerating since 2000
2. North Magnetic Pole drifting from Canada toward Siberia:
   - 10 km/year in early 1900s → 40 km/year in 2003 → continues accelerating
3. South Atlantic Anomaly (weakened field region) has grown and deepened
4. 2020 study: Maximum directional change rates reached ~10° per year
   - 100x faster than current changes, 10x faster than previously thought

**Superchrons (Periods of No Reversals)**:
- Cretaceous Normal Superchron: 120-83 million years ago (37 million years stable)
- Kiaman Reverse Superchron: 312-262 million years ago (>50 million years)
- These demonstrate reversals are not periodic

**2024-2026 Research Updates**:
- Research continues on deep Earth processes and field cycles
- 200-million-year intensity cycle identified from paleomagnetic studies
- ESA Swarm satellite mission provides ongoing monitoring
- No scientific basis for claims of "imminent reversal"

**Uncertainty Range**:
- Could happen tomorrow (geologically speaking)
- Could be tens to hundreds of thousands of years away
- Cannot be predicted with current science

**Evidence of Imminent Reversal? NO**:
- While field is weakening and behaving unusually, this is within normal variation
- Current strength and rate of change are within recorded historical bounds
- No "precursor" signals definitively indicate approaching reversal

**Outcome**: PASS
**Status**: COMPLETE
