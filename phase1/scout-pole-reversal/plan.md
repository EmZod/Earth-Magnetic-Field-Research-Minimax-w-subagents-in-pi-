# Plan: Research Magnetic Pole Reversals

## Agent
- Name: scout-pole-reversal
- Role: scout
- Model: MiniMax-M2.1 (thinking enabled)
- Tools: browser, bash, read, write

## Objective
Research the current scientific understanding of geomagnetic pole reversals: mechanics, historical frequency, and predictions about future reversals.

## Scope
### In Scope
- Pole reversal mechanics (what causes them)
- Historical reversal frequency and duration
- Current scientific predictions for next reversal
- Any evidence of imminent reversal
- Latest research findings (2024-2026)

### Out of Scope
- Field strength measurements (other scout)
- South Atlantic Anomaly details (other scout)
- Historical geological data (other scout)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Found authoritative sources (journals, institutions)
- [ ] Documented reversal mechanics
- [ ] Found current predictions/timelines
- [ ] Captured source URLs
- [ ] Summary in output/findings.md

## Steps

### STEP-01: Search for Current Research
**Objective**: Find authoritative sources on pole reversals
**Target**: Web search for scientific papers, NASA, NOAA, geophysics institutions
**Actions**:
1. Search "geomagnetic pole reversal 2025 research"
2. Search "magnetic pole flip prediction timeline"
3. Visit authoritative sources (NASA, ESA, universities)
**Success criteria**: Have 3-5 quality sources
**Output**: Raw notes in log.md

### STEP-02: Document Reversal Mechanics
**Objective**: Understand what causes pole reversals
**Target**: Scientific explanations
**Actions**:
1. Document how reversals work (core dynamics)
2. Note how long reversals take
3. Note effects during reversal
**Success criteria**: Clear explanation of mechanics
**Output**: Structured notes

### STEP-03: Timeline and Predictions
**Objective**: Find current predictions for next reversal
**Target**: Recent papers, expert statements
**Actions**:
1. Find current scientific consensus on timing
2. Note any updated views from 2024-2026
3. Document uncertainty ranges
**Success criteria**: Timeline estimates with sources
**Output**: Prediction summary

### STEP-04: Final Output
**Objective**: Compile deliverables
**Actions**:
1. Write output/findings.md with structured summary
2. Include all source URLs
3. Ensure log.md is complete
4. Write output/summary.txt (one paragraph)
**Output**: output/findings.md, output/summary.txt

## Logging Requirements
Create and maintain append-only `log.md`. 
- Before each step: Log objective, assumptions
- During: Log findings, progress, sources
- After: Log outcome (PASS/PARTIAL/FAIL), mark COMPLETE
NEVER edit previous entries. Fix forward only.
