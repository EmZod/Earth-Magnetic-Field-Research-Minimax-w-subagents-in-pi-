### ENTRY-001: Mission Start
**Timestamp**: 2026-01-13 21:19 GMT+5:30
**Action**: Reading plan.md and initializing research mission

---

### ENTRY-002: STEP-01 - Current Measurements Search
**Timestamp**: 2026-01-13 21:20 GMT+5:30
**Action**: Searching for current Earth magnetic field strength measurements

Searching: "Earth magnetic field strength 2025 measurements"
**Result**: Google blocked, trying ESA and NOAA directly
**Result**: Wikipedia article retrieved with comprehensive data

### ENTRY-003: Current Field Strength Data
**Timestamp**: 2026-01-13 21:25 GMT+5:30
**Source**: Wikipedia - Earth's magnetic field

**KEY DATA FOUNDED:**
- **Current surface field strength**: 25 to 65 μT (microteslas), or 0.25 to 0.65 Gauss
- **Dipole moment decreasing at rate**: ~6.3% per century (over last 2 centuries)
- **10-15% decline since late 1800s**
- **Acceleration noted since 2000**
- **Strong refrigerator magnet**: ~10,000 μT (100 G) - for comparison
- **Field minimum location**: South Atlantic Anomaly over South America
- **Field maxima**: Northern Canada, Siberia, and coast of Antarctica south of Australia

**Pole Movement:**
- North Magnetic Pole drifting from Canada toward Siberia
- Speed: 10 km/year (early 1900s) → 40 km/year (2003) → accelerating since then

**Sources**: Multiple scientific citations including NOAA, USGS, ESA Swarm data

### ENTRY-004: Historical Trends Analysis
**Timestamp**: 2026-01-13 21:35 GMT+5:30
**Source**: Wikipedia - Geomagnetic secular variation

**HISTORICAL TREND DATA:**
- **Dipole strength decay rate**: 6.3% per century (over last 2 centuries)
- **Time to reach zero at current rate**: ~1600 years (NOTIFY: this is misleading, see note below)
- **Historical range**: Field has gone up and down over millennia
- **Average for last 7,000 years**: Current strength is about average
- **Current rate of change**: Not unusual in geological context

**KEY INSIGHT**: While the field is decreasing at 6.3%/century, this is:
1. Within normal range of geological variation
2. Part of natural oscillation cycles (~200 million years)
3. Similar to historical patterns seen in paleomagnetic records
4. NOT necessarily leading to imminent reversal or collapse

**Westward drift**: Non-dipolar part drifts westward at ~0.2°/year

### ENTRY-005: Acceleration Analysis
**Timestamp**: 2026-01-13 21:40 GMT+5:30
**FINDINGS ON ACCELERATION:**

**Evidence FOR Acceleration:**
1. **10-15% decline since late 1800s** - significant multi-century trend
2. **Pole acceleration**: 10 km/year (1900s) → 40 km/year (2003) → faster since then
3. **Recent scientific concern**: 2019 Nature article "Earth's magnetic field is acting up and geologists don't know why"

**Evidence AGAINST (context):**
1. Field fluctuates randomly (heteroscedastic)
2. Current strength is average for last 7,000 years
3. Similar fluctuations observed throughout geological history
4. No definitive evidence this is faster than normal variation

**CONCLUSION**: The decay IS accelerating compared to the long-term average, BUT:
- This may be natural variation
- 1600-year projection to zero is misleading
- Previous similar periods recovered without collapse
- Cannot extrapolate long-term trends from short-term data
