# Plan: Research Magnetic Field Strength Changes

## Agent
- Name: scout-field-strength
- Role: scout
- Model: MiniMax-M2.1 (thinking enabled)
- Tools: browser, bash, read, write

## Objective
Research the current measurements and trends in Earth's magnetic field strength, including decay rates and whether deterioration is accelerating.

## Scope
### In Scope
- Current field strength measurements
- Historical strength trends (past centuries)
- Rate of field weakening
- Whether decay is accelerating
- Latest satellite data (Swarm mission, etc.)
- 2024-2026 research findings

### Out of Scope
- Pole reversal mechanics (other scout)
- SAA specifics (other scout)
- Paleomagnetic history (other scout)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Found current field strength data
- [ ] Documented decay rate with sources
- [ ] Found whether acceleration is occurring
- [ ] Cited authoritative sources
- [ ] Summary in output/findings.md

## Steps

### STEP-01: Find Current Measurements
**Objective**: Locate authoritative field strength data
**Target**: ESA Swarm, NOAA, USGS
**Actions**:
1. Search "Earth magnetic field strength 2025 measurements"
2. Search "Swarm satellite magnetic field data"
3. Find current dipole moment values
**Success criteria**: Have quantitative data with dates
**Output**: Raw data in log.md

### STEP-02: Document Historical Trends
**Objective**: Understand field strength over time
**Target**: Scientific papers on field decay
**Actions**:
1. Find data on field strength over past 200 years
2. Note decay rate (% per century/decade)
3. Compare to geological timescales
**Success criteria**: Historical trend data
**Output**: Trend analysis

### STEP-03: Acceleration Analysis
**Objective**: Determine if decay is accelerating
**Target**: Recent research on decay rate changes
**Actions**:
1. Search "magnetic field decay acceleration 2025"
2. Find expert opinions on current trajectory
3. Note any concerning findings
**Success criteria**: Clear answer on acceleration with sources
**Output**: Acceleration findings

### STEP-04: Final Output
**Objective**: Compile deliverables
**Actions**:
1. Write output/findings.md with structured summary
2. Include all source URLs
3. Ensure log.md is complete
4. Write output/summary.txt (one paragraph)
**Output**: output/findings.md, output/summary.txt

## Logging Requirements
Create and maintain append-only `log.md`. NEVER edit previous entries.
