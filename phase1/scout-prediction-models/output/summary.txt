EARTH MAGNETIC FIELD PREDICTION MODELS - SUMMARY
=================================================
Scout: scout-prediction-models | Date: January 13, 2026

MAJOR MODELS
------------
1. World Magnetic Model (WMM2025) - Navigation standard, updated Dec 2024
2. International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF-14) - Scientific reference, Nov 2024
3. Enhanced Magnetic Model (EMM) - High-resolution crustal anomalies
4. Geodynamo Simulations - Research only, not predictive

KEY PREDICTIONS
---------------
- North pole: Moving ~55 km/year toward Russia (now at 85.76°N, 139.30°E)
- Field strength: Declining ~5% per century (NOT indicating imminent reversal)
- Reversals: CANNOT BE PREDICTED - statistically random, last was 780,000 years ago

LIMITATIONS
-----------
- Reliable predictions: ~5 years maximum
- 2019 required emergency model update due to unexpected pole acceleration
- Long-term (50-100 year) predictions are NOT scientifically reliable
- Core dynamics are chaotic - fundamental prediction limit

BOTTOM LINE
-----------
Models work well for navigation/compass corrections over 5-year epochs but cannot 
forecast long-term field behavior. A magnetic reversal could begin at any time or 
not for millions of years - science cannot distinguish between these scenarios.
