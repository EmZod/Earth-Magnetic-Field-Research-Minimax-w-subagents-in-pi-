# Plan: Research Prediction Models and Forecasts

## Agent
- Name: scout-prediction-models
- Role: scout
- Model: MiniMax-M2.1 (thinking enabled)
- Tools: browser, bash, read, write

## Objective
Research computational models used to predict Earth's magnetic field behavior and what they forecast for coming decades.

## Scope
### In Scope
- Geodynamo models and simulations
- Field prediction models (IGRF, WMM)
- What models predict for next 50-100 years
- Model limitations and uncertainties
- Any AI/ML approaches to prediction
- 2024-2026 modeling advances

### Out of Scope
- Observational data (other scouts)
- Historical records (other scout)
- SAA specifics (other scout)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Documented major prediction models
- [ ] Found forecasts for coming decades
- [ ] Noted model limitations
- [ ] Cited authoritative sources
- [ ] Summary in output/findings.md

## Steps

### STEP-01: Find Major Models
**Objective**: Identify key prediction systems
**Target**: NOAA, BGS, scientific papers
**Actions**:
1. Search "geomagnetic field prediction model 2025"
2. Search "World Magnetic Model IGRF forecast"
3. Find geodynamo simulation research
**Success criteria**: List of major models
**Output**: Model inventory in log.md

### STEP-02: Model Predictions
**Objective**: What do models forecast?
**Target**: Model outputs and papers
**Actions**:
1. Find predictions for pole movement
2. Find predictions for field strength
3. Note any reversal predictions
**Success criteria**: Concrete forecasts with timeframes
**Output**: Prediction summary

### STEP-03: Limitations and Uncertainties
**Objective**: Understand model reliability
**Target**: Scientific discussions on modeling
**Actions**:
1. What are known model limitations?
2. How far ahead can we predict?
3. What would models miss?
**Success criteria**: Clear limitation analysis
**Output**: Limitation notes

### STEP-04: Final Output
**Objective**: Compile deliverables
**Actions**:
1. Write output/findings.md
2. Include all source URLs
3. Write output/summary.txt
**Output**: output/findings.md, output/summary.txt

## Logging Requirements
Create and maintain append-only `log.md`. NEVER edit previous entries.
